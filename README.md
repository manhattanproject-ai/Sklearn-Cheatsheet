## Introduction-What-is-Sklearn?

> NumPy (Numerical Python) is the fundamental library for numerical computing in Python, providing powerful capabilities for working with large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices. At its core, NumPy introduces the ndarray object, which is significantly more efficient for storing and manipulating numerical data than standard Python lists, especially for large datasets. It offers a vast collection of high-level mathematical functions to operate on these arrays, covering linear algebra, Fourier transforms, random number generation, and more. NumPy's efficiency stems from its implementation in C and Fortran, allowing for high-performance operations that are crucial for scientific computing, data analysis, and machine learning, making it an indispensable building block for many other Python libraries like Pandas and Scikit-learn.


## 1. Importing Scikit-learn Modules

> This section covers the standard way to bring the NumPy library into your Python scripts.

|Command | description|
|----------|-------------|
|`import sklearn`|	Imports the entire Scikit-learn library. Rarely used directly, as specific modules are typically imported.|
|`from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split`|	Imports the train_test_split function from the model_selection module, used for splitting data into training and testing sets.|
|`from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler`|	Imports StandardScaler from the preprocessing module, used for standardizing features by removing the mean and scaling to unit variance.|
|`from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression`|	Imports LogisticRegression from the linear_model module, a common classification algorithm.|
|`from sklearn.svm import SVC`|	Imports SVC (Support Vector Classifier) from the svm module, another classification algorithm.|
|`from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier`|	Imports DecisionTreeClassifier from the tree module, for classification based on decision trees.|
|`from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier`|	Imports RandomForestClassifier from the ensemble module, an ensemble classification method.|
|`from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score`|	Imports accuracy_score from the metrics module, used for evaluating model performance.|
|`from sklearn.cluster import KMeans`|	Imports KMeans from the cluster module, a popular clustering algorithm.|
|`from sklearn.decomposition import PCA`|	Imports PCA (Principal Component Analysis) from the decomposition module, for dimensionality reduction.|
|`from sklearn.pipeline import Pipeline`|	Imports Pipeline from the pipeline module, used to chain multiple processing steps together.|
|`from sklearn.datasets import load_iris`|	Imports load_iris from the datasets module, used for loading sample datasets built into Sklearn.|
|`from sklearn.impute import SimpleImputer`|	Imports SimpleImputer from the impute module, for handling missing values.|
|`from sklearn.model_selection import GridSearchCV`|	Imports GridSearchCV from the model_selection module, for systematic hyperparameter tuning.|
